class TestDatanommerWat(Base):
    """ Generally speaking, the `datanommer
    <https://github.com/fedora-infra/datanommer>`_ consumer does not publish
    its own fedmsg messages.  There is one exception to this rule.

    As of fedmsg-0.7.0, every fedmsg carries its own uuid, prefixed with the
    year it was published.   There is a very low risk of creating a duplicate
    uuid.  To quote wikipedia::

        "The annual risk of someone being hit by a meteorite is estimated to be
        one chance in 17 billion, which means the probability is about
        ``0.00000000006 (6 * 10**-11)``, equivalent to the odds of creating a
        few tens of trillions of UUIDs in a year and having one duplicate"

    It is highly unlikely that datanommer will ever try to store a fedmsg
    message that carries a uuid that already exists in its database.  In the
    event that it does, it will publish the following message; a momentous
    occasion.
